## Lore
Tommy isn't the bravest cat on earth, neither the most active. He is quite lazy in fact. Someday while on cloud nine *- pun intended -* he did manage to go on a little adventure but he got himself stuck in a witch's hut. Kyuubi, a black cat who is a close friend of Tommy was also *there on a shelf*. This did leave Tommy a little stunned but as weird as it sounds, it might explain why Kyuubi is always nowhere to be found. Since Tommy isn't the bravest or the most active he rellies on your help to collect the fragments, avoid ghosts and escape from the witch's hut. Otherwise he will most likely just nap there.
